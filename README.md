# Habit Stats

A personal project that I'll hopefully be able to use on a regular basis

## Goals with this project

* Get experience with ISAR (offline noSQL database)
    - Being comfortable storing data locally with noSQL should be a given at this point.

* Create and iterate on my own feedback loop.
    - In order to develop a better understanding of the developer-user relationship I should place myself in both camps.

* Avoid feature creep and intentionally focus on polish and bringing the app "alive" with animations and smooth transitions.
    - Gain experience in making an app that is pleasurable to use.

* Work on visualizing data
    - Learn how to showcase data in a visually attractive / intriguing way. Being able to do this properly feels like the difference between a good (but boring) and a great app.
